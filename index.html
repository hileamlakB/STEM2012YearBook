            Life has its twists! Most of the time unpridicatable. Predictable or unpridictable, <br>
            destiny or just a concidenc, a people follow paths and creat new once every day. In one <br>
            of these days 50 kids from here and there came together to spend the next 4 years in a <br> 
            place where they would grow intellectually and socialy. Here today after 1460 days we have <br>
            finally come to the finish, the point where we say goodbay to each other and depart in our own ways<br>
            or may be together. But it isnt a bad idea to retain those 4 year memories in a year book. which<br>
            is what this website is about. So enjoy a glimpse of the 4 years.
